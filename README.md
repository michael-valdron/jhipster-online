## Quick start guide

JHipster Online is a JHipster application, so you can follow the [JHipster documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/) to
learn how to configure and set up JHipster Online.

This quick start guide uses the default configuration that comes with JHipster Online: please read
the next section for details on configuring the application.

- Install and run the front-end:

```
yarn install && yarn start
```

- Run the database:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mysql.yml up -d
```

- Run the back-end:

```
./mvnw
```

## Specific configuration

This section covers what is specific to JHipster Online over a normal JHipster application.

For standard JHipster configuration, the [JHipster common application properties](https://www.jhipster.tech/common-application-properties/)
will probably be very useful.

### JHipster installation and execution

JHipster Online generates a JHipster application by running the `jhipster` command line. In order for that
command line to work, you need to have JHipster installed on your machine.

We recommend you use the "Yarn installation" from the official [JHipster installation documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/).

If you need more configuration options for running the JHipster command, you can modify:

- the location of the `jhipster` command
- the timeout value for that command (the default is 120 seconds - please note that on our production server a generation usually
  takes 5 to 6 seconds)
- the temporary folder in which the application will be generated (`/tmp` by default)

Those are customized using the Spring Boot `application-*.yml` files as usual, for example:

```
application:
    jhipster-cmd:
        cmd: /usr/local/bin/jhipster
        timeout: 60
    tmp-folder: /tmp
```

### Database configuration

JHipster Online works with a MySQL database, that is configured in the usual `application-*.yml` Spring Boot configuration
files, using the standard `spring.datasource` keys.

### Security

JHipster Online uses JWT to secure the application. For a production application, it is therefore **mandatory** that:

- The `jhipster.security.authentication.jwt.key` is configured, and that key is stored securely (**not** commited in your application's Git repository).
  We recommend to configure it as an environment variable on your server, or in a specific Spring Boot `application.yml` file that is stored
  in your application's folder on your production server (which is our configuration on the official [JHipster Online website](https://start.jhipster.tech/)).
- The application is only available through HTTPS. You can configure it using Spring Boot (please read the comments in the `application-prod.yml` file), or
  using an Apache 2 HTTP server with Let's Encrypt on front of your application (which is our configuration on the official [JHipster Online website](https://start.jhipster.tech/)).

### Mail

E-mails are used to validate users' e-mail addresses or to send "forgotten password" e-mails. They are disabled by default,
but it might be a good idea to configure them once the application is in production.

To configure e-mail sending, you need to configure the `jhipster.mail` keys (see [JHipster common application properties](https://www.jhipster.tech/common-application-properties/)),
and the Spring Boot standard `spring.mail` keys.

When running the app with the `dev` profile, make sure to start the development mail server with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mailserver.yml up -d
```

You can view the mails sent by JHipster with the MailHog UI at [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).

### GitHub configuration

GitHub is configured using the `application.github` keys in the `application-*.yml` configuration files.

JHipster Online can work on the public GitHub instance on [https://github.com](https://github.com) as well
as any private instance of GitHub Enterprise that is configured inside your company.

JHipster Online has to be configured as an "OAuth App": create a `jhipster` organization,
and go to that organization's "Settings > Developer Settings > OAuth Apps" to create a new "OAuth App" with
the required credentials. This will allow JHipster Online to create applications and pull requests on your
behalf. JHipster Online uses `https://your-jhipster-online-url/api/github/callback` as callback endpoint.

JHipster Online also needs to have a specific "JHipster Bot" user configured, like the  
[https://github.com/jhipster-bot](https://github.com/jhipster-bot) used by the official [JHipster Online website](https://start.jhipster.tech/).

Here is the final configuration, that should be set up inside the `application-dev.yml` file for
development, and inside the `application-prod.yml` file for production.

```
application:
    github:
        host: https://github.com # The GitHub to connect to (by default: the public GitHub instance)
        client-id: XXX # The OAuth Client ID of the application on GitHub
        client-secret: XXX # The OAuth Client secret of the application on GitHub
```

### GitLab configuration

Similarly to GitHub, your GitLab configuration must be placed in your `application-*.yml` using the `application.gitlab`
keys.

JHipster Online can work on the public GitLab instance on [https://gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) as well
as any private instance of GitLab that is configured inside your company.

JHipster Online needs to have a specific "JHipster Bot" user configured: create that user (if you have your own private instance, you can call it
`jhipster-bot`, otherwise choose the name you like), and log in using that user.

Once logged in, the required API credentials can be created by going to "Settings > Applications > Add new application".
Create a new application:

- Its name is `jhipster`
- The redirect URI is `https://your-jhipster-online-url/api/gitlab/callback`
- It has the `api` and `read_user` scopes

Save that new application and store safely the `Application Id` and `Secret` values, so you can use them to configure
the `application-*.yml` files.

Here is the final configuration, that should be set up inside the `application-dev.yml` file for
development, and inside the `application-prod.yml` file for production.

```
application:
    gitlab:
        host: https://gitlab.com # The GitLab to connect to. The main public GitLab instance is default here.
        client-id: XXX # Your GitLab application Id
        client-secret: XXX # Your GitLab application secret
        redirect-uri: XXX   # The URI where the user will be redirected after GitLab authentication. This URI
                            # must be registered in you GitLab application callback URLs
```


### Using Docker

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
docker build -t jhonline .
```

Then run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

### Using Developer Sandbox

#### Launch Red Hat Dev Spaces

```
Import from Git and Open Terminal
```

## Deployment to Google App Engine (GAE) Flexible Environment

- The project can be deployed to [GAE flexible environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/) by simply [creating a tagged release](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-online/releases).

- Creating a new release triggers the [deploy.yml GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-online/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

- The above workflow includes a Docker build and pushes the image to [Google Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/). [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) and [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) are used for
  obtaining application logs and monitoring.

#### Steps for Deployment

- Increment the version numbers in [`pom.xml`](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-online/blob/d61bdbc3b6354516756c57626455be180eb4352e/pom.xml#L8) and [`package.json`](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-online/blob/d61bdbc3b6354516756c57626455be180eb4352e/package.json#L3).
- Create a tagged release. All you have to do is got to the [releases section](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-online/releases)
